# L1: Introduction to Pharmacology

!!! note "Pharmacology"
    The study of the mechanisms by which drugs affect the function of a living system

## opiates

- opiates are some of the oldest known drugs
    - from plant sources (opium poppy)
    - have an analgesic effect, although in higher doses can cause euphoria
    - the euphoric effect can be abused, due to the substances being highly addictive (and severe withdrawal effects)
- in the late 1800s, the active compound for morphine was identified and isolated
    - chemists researched the morphine molecule, resulting in the synthesis of heroin
    - heroin and aspirin were sold as non-addictive forms of morphine
- fentanyl is a highly potent opioid - some 100x more potent than morphine, and therefore easier for an individual to overdose on
- opiates bind to receptors in order to exert an influence
- during the 1970s, endorphins were discovered - a natural, endogenous opioid, being a peptide hormone
- met-enkephalin is secreted as a neurotransmitter
    - was isolated from brains of pigs
    - has a very similar molecular structure to morphine
    - fits in the same receptor as morphine
- morphine mimics an endogenous pathway, activating ‘reward’ pathways

## drugs

!!! note "Drug"
    A chemical that, on administration to a living organism, elicits a biological effect

- drugs take different formats:
    - synthetic chemicals
    - plant chemicals
    - biopharmaceuticals
- synthetic- and plant-based chemicals are both small molecule drugs
- poisons, venoms, and toxins can be from any drug type

!!! note "Medicine"
    A chemical preparation usually containing 1+ drugs administered to produce a therapeutic effect these often contain excipients, stabilisers, solvents, …

## biopharmaceuticals

- these are either:
    - proteins
    copies of endogenous proteins (insulin, …)
    engineered proteins
    antibodies
    - oligonucleotides
    made of DNA, RNA
- gene therapy
    - the process of adding new genetic material to cells, in order to prevent, alleviate, or cure a disease
- regenerative therapy
    - engineered stem cells, used to replace irreparably damaged organs

biopharmaceuticals are also known as biologics

1st gen:
- copies of endogenous proteins produced by recombinant DNA technology

2nd gen:

- ‘engineered’ proteins improve performance of the natural ‘wild type’ form
- (as with some types of insulin, producing faster acting forms)
- also used in haemophilia and thrombolysis action
- generally used to treat the symptoms of a disease extracellularly

### engineered humanised monoclonal antibodies

- a large area of research, particularly for new treatments targeting cancer, immune diseases, …
- antibodies are engineered to trick the body into thinking it is ‘human’ through humanisation - this is done using human sequences in the Fc region of the antibody
    - the Fab region is designed to attack to the target protein
    - monoclonal antibodies must be humanised, otherwise an immune response can be formed in response to the MAb
- monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are very effective, with few side effects, however are very expensive
    - drug names for monoclonal antibodies always ends in -mab

### mRNA vaccines

- vaccines using mRNA are biologics
- the use of mRNA vaccines for Covid demonstrated the ability to administer mRNA instead of synthesising complex molecules
- genomic data can be used in pharmacology (pharmacogenetics), which allows predicted reactions with drugs to be determined

!!! note "Pharmacogenomics"
    Personalising medicine to allow the identification of the most effective treatment strategy

!!! note "Pharmacoeconomics"
    Economics and cost related to new drugs is a drug cost effective? is the cost worth the potential benefit?

## most drugs exert their action by interacting with proteins

- drugs can interact with receptors, enzymes, transporters, ion channels
- other macromolecules with drug interactions are ‘drug targets’

### receptors

!!! note "Receptors"
    Proteins responsible for recognising and responding to exogenous chemical signals, detecting environmental change or chemical mediators

- exposed on the exterior of the cell
- identified and classified by structure, pharmacology, and signalling mechanism
- respond specifically to certain drug classes
    - no drug is completed specific, so an increase in dose results in unwanted side effects and toxicity, due to other targets being affected
    - control of a drugs concentration is critical to reducing side effects while still having the desired physiological effect
- the malfunction or loss of a receptor results in disease

### receptors are important protein targets of drugs

!!! note "Agonist"
    A drug binding to a receptor protein, leading to the activation of the receptor and causing a change in cell function

- agonists bind to the target protein in the same way as the endogenous protein, and lead to the activation of the same pathway

inverse agonist — an agonist binding to a receptor, inhibiting any signalling pathway

!!! note "Antagonist"
    A drug binding to a receptor, inhibiting its action

- antagonists can be used therapeutically, preventing an endogenous mediator from exerting action
- fentanyl would be an agonist, while naloxone would be the antagonist (allowing the reversal of an overdose)

### drug binding to a receptor

- opiates act through opioid receptors, a type of GPCR
- understanding which parts of the brain contain opioid receptors allows the determination of the regions involved in reward pathways and pain recognition
    - morphine, heroine and fentanyl are all agonists of $\mu$-opioid receptors
- the chronic use of opiates results in constipation and reduction in control of breathing (which results in asphyxiation)

### channel proteins

- channel proteins are a target of drugs
- blockers prevent molecules from passing through a channel
- modulators increase or decrease the probability a channel will be open or closed
- lidocaine blocks voltage-gated $\text{Na}^+$ channels
- valium increases the activity of $\text{GABA}_\text{A}$ ligand gated ion channels
    - fentanyl can be laced with valium

### enzymes

- an inhibitor prevents a normal reaction from occurring by blocking or altering the shape of the active site
- false substrates result in an abnormal metabolite being produced
- a prodrug is a drug precursor, which is converted to its active form through an enzymatic reaction, allowing the prolongation of drug activity
- aspirin prevents the production of inflammatory mediators involved in headaches, pain, … through preventing enzyme action
